# mmap-payload
Nim program that allocate memory on the heap as executable and execute a payload inside

# compile
You can compile the source code using:  
```
nim c --d:release mmap_payload.nim
```

# result
It should look similar to this:
```
âžœ ./mmap_payload 
0x7ff421f62000 = mmap(nil, 57, 6, 34, -1, 0)
Hello, World !
Hello, Nim is Powerful :)
```
- The memory is freed after usage

# payload
The payload in the source code is a simple Hello World in 64bit asm:
```
   0:   55                      push   %rbp
   1:   48 89 e5                mov    %rsp,%rbp
   4:   48 b8 6f 72 6c 64 20    movabs $0xa0a2120646c726f,%rax
   b:   21 0a 0a 
   e:   50                      push   %rax
